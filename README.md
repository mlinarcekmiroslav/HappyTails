Final Project on Frontend Beginer course

This is my final project on Frontend Beginer course and my first step into IT industries as a web developer.
In coding this website I used HTML5 and CSS3.
This website has header part including navigation bar, main part with 5 sections including one form, and footer part including social media icon links.
